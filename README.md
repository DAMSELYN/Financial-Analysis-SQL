SteelData CHALLENGE 4 FINANCIAL INSIGHTS ANALYSIS


This challenge involves using SQL to analyze a dataset from the 'The Big Bank'.
As a financial analyst, i have  been tasked with finding out about the customers and their banking behaviour,Examine the accounts they hold and the type of transactions they make to develop greater insight about the customers.
Through this exercise, I was able to gain valuable insights into the customers' banking habits, including the types of accounts they hold and the frequency and types of transactions they make. These insights will help me to better understand the customers' needs and preferences, and ultimately improve our ability to provide them with the best possible banking experience.
Using SQL, I was able to use the CONCAT(), aggregate functions such as SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG() to extract and analyze data from the customer accounts, including account types, balances, transaction amounts, branches, and transaction types. This allowed me to identify patterns in the customers' banking behavior, such as the most popular types of accounts and transaction types, as well as the most active customers.
Overall, I am excited to have had the opportunity to participate in this challenge and to use my skills to gain insights.
I look forward to continuing to leverage data and analytics to drive innovation
